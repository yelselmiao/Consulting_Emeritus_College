## Description
UBC Emeritus College is conducting a survey of over 1200 members to garner qualitative feedback on the college program and activities. The data was collected using the UBC Qualtrics tools from 456 respondents. The following goals are formulated: to validated whether the survey respondents are representative of the Emeritus College members who were sent the surveys in terms of gender, age, and year of retirement; to investigate whether the patterns of responses rely on gender, age, and year of retirement.  

These goals are explored by examining the distribution of different groups in the survey results based on gender, age, and year of retirement respectively. We begin in Section 2 to reiterate the general grouping principle for the variable age and year of retirement. Section 3 employs visualizations and tables to demonstrate the representativeness of survey respondents. Section 4 presents the analysis of response patterns for each survey question respectively.
